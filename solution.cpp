/*Problem statement : According to the file i have received with name frontend but the problem is of DSA

You are given an N Ã— N matrix in which every cell is colored black or white. Columns are numbered from 0
to N-1 (from left to right). This coloring is represented by a non-empty array of integers A. If the K-th
number in the array is equal to X then the X lowest cells in the K-th column of the matrix are black. The
rest of the cells in the K-th column are white. The task is to calculate the side length of the biggest black
square (a square containing only black cells).Write a function:class Solution { public int solution(int[] A);
}that, given an array of integers A of length N representing the coloring of the matrix, returns the side
length of the biggest black square.

test cases are in image format : refer to PDF of question
